### Usage basics
As C is a compiled language (as opposed to scripting ones, such as Python, which are usually run via a virtual machine), it needs to be processed from source code to machine before it may be executed. For simple projects, this is done only by compiling, but substeps include linking, preprocessing, etc. which may be explored further on. 

For achieving this task, several compilers have been written, which follow the C standard as definied by a comittee of several developers & contributors. However, the most important ones as of the moment are GCC or LLVM/Clang, the first of which is the one being used currently by the author.
