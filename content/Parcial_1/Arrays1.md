### Definition
Arrays are a type of __data structure__ that store information in a collection, using for retrieval or storage _keys_ or _indexes_ which is an integer value that begins from 0 and goes on until N-1, where N is the number of elements in the array. One dimensional arrays consist of a linear sequence of data stored contiguously in memory. 

### Essential operations
* Statement & Assignment
* Swapping
    * Requires an additional variable
    * Three stepped process
    * Used in many different algorithms
* Cirular shifting
    * Displacing the array by n places
* Reversing
* Bubble sorting
    * The simplest sorting algorithm compares adjacent values until all values satisfy the specified conditions

#### C-like Syntax

~~~~c
//Declaration and statement
type an_array[THE_SIZE] = {SOME_VARIABLES};

~~~~
