Arrays are a type of __data structure__ that store information in a collection, using for retrieval or storage _keys_ or _indexes_ which is an integer value that begins from 0 and goes on until N-1, where N is the number of elements in the array. One dimensional arrays consist of a linear sequence of data stored contiguously in memory.
