Title: About
Date: 2015-02-10
My name is Sergio Ugalde Marcano and I am a student of IBCS. the purpose of this page, which is to be constantly updated, is to document learning and notes, to serve as both an evidence and a guide, for learning about computer science. 
I expect my abilities (both as a programmer and developing this content), to evolve as time goes on, so even though the quality of the content & skills may not be top-notch as of the moment of writing this, hopefully, one day, it will be decent enough, after all, that is one of the results of learning.
Currently this site is built using Pelican, and hosted on Github Pages, however, this is subject to modification as more tools are explored.
