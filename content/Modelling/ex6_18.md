Summary: This program simulates an flock with varying properties.

## Experience
The main modifications done in this program was the implementation the of the noise function. It was not really a big one, as only a few lines were modified. However, some refactoring had to be done in order for variables to be available in other scopes from the original ones. Originally, I intended to use sliders, but due to the disperse documentation and  time restraints I decided to go with Perlin Noise instead. In order to visualize the noise in a more significant way, the size of the objects vary acording to the ratio of cohesion to separation. However, this addition did not have an effect as evident as expected. 

## Code
(included only modifications)
:::java
    void calculate(){
        beginNoise = 0.005*noiseStep++;
        maxspeed = noise(beginNoise)*6;
        maxforce = noise(beginNoise)*0.15;
        sepw = noise(beginNoise)*4;
        aliw = noise(beginNoise)*3;
        cohw = noise(beginNoise)*3;
        sep.mult(sepw);
        ali.mult(aliw);
        coh.mult(cohw);
        println("SEPW: "+sepw);
    }

          void render() {
        // Draw a triangle rotated in the direction of velocity
        float theta = velocity.heading2D() + radians(90);
        fill(175);
        stroke(0);
        pushMatrix();
        translate(location.x,location.y);
        rotate(theta);
        beginShape(TRIANGLES);
        vertex(0*sepw/cohw, -r*2*sepw/cohw);
        vertex(-r*sepw/cohw, r*2*sepw/cohw);
        vertex(r*sepw/cohw, r*2*sepw/cohw);
        endShape();
        popMatrix();
      }
        void flock(ArrayList<Boid> boids) {
        sep = separate(boids);   // Separation
        ali = align(boids);      // Alignment
        coh = cohesion(boids);   // Cohesion
        // Arbitrarily weight these forces
        calculate();
        // Add the force vectors to acceleration
        applyForce(sep);
        applyForce(ali);
        applyForce(coh);
      }
